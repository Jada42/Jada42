# Well, hello there! 👋

I do self-driven AI research and test small language architectures. Fan of **hybrid models and gating**

## 🔬 Research Interests
- AI Alignment & Transparency
- Value-Aligned AI
- (Hybrid)Language Model Architectures (SSMs; Hopfield; Latent Transformers)
- Time-Series Modeling of Psychological Behavior
- Autoregressive Time-Series Simulation Modeling of Astronaut Stress data, incl. Temporal Fusion Transformers


## Deployed 
- 🎸 **[GearChat](https://manualgpt.streamlit.app)** - RAG-powered chatbot for musicians to chat with their intruments manual (synthesizers, drum-machines etc.) (deployed)

## 📚 Recent Work

- 🌌 **[CALM-Seal](https://github.com/Jada42/Hybrid-CALM-on-Z)** - A hybrid implementation of Shao et al. their Continuous Autoregressive Language Modeling (CALM) fused with State Space Models (SSM) and Hopfield Networks and gating + rectified flow.
- 🧠 **[Hamba](https://medium.com/@julyweiss/attention-and-beyond-building-a-hybrid-brain-inspired-language-model-3e6adcc39398)** - Novel hybrid hopfield + mamba inspired architecture combining SSMs and Hopfield networks with attention (BPE PPL of 28.6 vs GPT-2's 29 with 30% less params and two hierarchical reasoning passes (Segmented-Reasoning) and rectified flow.
- 🏛️ **[MSC: RLAIF/RLHF for Public Value Alignment Enhancing Transparency in LLMs](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dJJkhk5nZoXfiQgHz/rlaif-rlhf-for-public-value-alignment-enhancing-transparency)** - Master's thesis on aligning Mistral-7b with democratic transparency values (VU Amsterdam, 2025)

- 📊 **[Time-Varying VAR/GAM and Temporal Fusion Models](Repository)** - Extension of my BSc extrapolated to astronauts on a 1 year mission. Predicting psychological behavior from simulated Astronaut data over a year with 3% shock event data (positive & negative) (VU University Amsterdam, 2024)

- More can be seen in Repo's :-)


## Older ML Work
- 📊 **[BSC: Time-Varying Non-linear Emotion Modelling: Vector Autoregression and Generalized Additive Models Models](Repository)** - Predicting psychological behavior from EMA data (Soyster et al., 2020) (Maastricht University, 2022)
